Update request-variables rules.

Look at commit: $ARGUMENTS

This commit upgraded an endpoint to use request variables. The file
~/.claude/commands/request-variables.md contains a list of migration rules at
the end of it that are designed to tell you how to migrate any endpoint to use
request variables. Please update that list of rules so that it would have worked
correctly to produce the changes in this commit.

Assume that the list of rules is correct, so that any discrepancies between what
the rules say and the contents of the commit are just due to the rules not being
general enough. Make sure that after you update the list of rules there are no
duplicate rules in this list of rules and no conflicting rules.

If there are no meaningful changes to the list of rules to propose, that's fine.
